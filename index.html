                <p>
                    The purpose of my project was to highlight Black women in high-fashion editorials, addressing the critical issue of underrepresentation in the industry. Black models have historically faced significant barriers in high fashion, and my goal was to create stunning images that not only empower Black women but also underscore the importance of their presence in editorial spaces. By crafting striking visuals, I aimed to inspire young Black women, providing them with relatable representations in a realm that often overlooks their contributions. Through this project, I hoped to spark a conversation about inclusivity in fashion, reinforcing that diverse voices and faces are essential to the industry's narrative.
                    
                    My planning process began with reaching out to a talented team, including models, a stylist, and a makeup artist, to collaborate on my concept. I pitched the idea of creating a dynamic duo that embodies high contrast, akin to a yin-yang motif while maintaining a high-fashion aesthetic. Collaborating closely with stylist Liamochicken was key; I encouraged him to explore proportions and layering while sticking to a black-and-white color scheme. His decision to incorporate red as an accent not only added depth to the overall styling but also enhanced the richness of the models' skin tones. For makeup, I turned to Natalie Seneca, who skillfully crafted a complementary look that wouldn't overpower the outfits. She chose to keep the makeup light while delivering a bold dark red lip lined with dark brown hues for the first model. For the second model, Amberley Jacintha, she opted for a flesh-toned lip, creating a cohesive aesthetic that seamlessly tied both looks together, reinforcing the unity of the project.
                    
                    In terms of lighting, I aimed for a high-contrast look to amplify the boldness of the images. I employed three strobe lights, each positioned strategically to achieve the desired effect. The first strobe light, equipped with a Magnum reflector, was mounted on a boom arm directly above the models. This served as both a hair light and backlight, providing separation from the background while creating a halo effect around the models. To control light spill and maintain focus on the subject, I attached a black cloth to the back of the light. My second light, featuring an Octo softbox, was positioned in front of the model at a 45-degree angle. This setup allowed for soft, flattering light to fill in the right side of the model's face, reducing harsh shadows and enhancing the overall complexion. Additionally, I utilized a third strobe light positioned behind a V-flat angled toward the background. This light illuminated the backdrop, ensuring it had enough depth and interest without detracting from the models.
                    
                    One of the challenges I faced throughout this process was effectively directing movement and posing between two models while creating two distinct yet cohesive looks. This required meticulous time management, ensuring each model had ample opportunity to shine in their respective outfits. I had to keep a keen eye on how long each look took to style and shoot, balancing my time while capturing the right shots. The need for clear communication with both models and my team was essential in maintaining a smooth workflow, allowing us to remain focused on the vision without losing momentum. This experience reinforced the importance of collaboration in achieving a unified artistic vision, highlighting how crucial each team member's input is to the overall success of a project.
                    
                    In summary, this project not only sought to highlight the beauty and strength of Black women in high-fashion editorials but also aimed to address the pressing issue of representation within the industry. Through careful planning, collaboration, and a cohesive design approach, I was able to create striking visuals that celebrate diversity and challenge the conventional narratives in fashion. The use of high-contrast lighting and thoughtfully curated styling played a pivotal role in conveying the project's message, while the seamless teamwork among models, stylist, and makeup artist ensured that each look resonated with the intended aesthetic. Ultimately, this endeavor served as a powerful reminder of the importance of inclusivity in fashion, inspiring both the participants and the audience to recognize and value the contributions of Black women in this space.

                <p>
                    My project aimed to highlight Black women in the high-fashion modeling industry, addressing the critical issue of underrepresentation in high-fashion editorial photography. Through this initiative, I sought to create a platform that celebrates the diversity and beauty of Black women, particularly within the alternative fashion scene, which often pushes boundaries and challenges conventional aesthetics. By focusing on this niche, I aimed not only to showcase the unique styles of these women but also to promote a broader conversation about representation in a field that has historically overlooked them. I intended to create a series that not only captures stunning visuals but also conveys a powerful message about inclusivity and diversity in high fashion.
                    
                    The planning process was crucial in refining my vision and ensuring that it aligned with my goal of representing Black women in fashion. After identifying my niche—specifically alternative editorial high fashion—I turned to Pinterest to create a mood board that encapsulated the aesthetic I wanted to achieve. This mood board served as a visual reference, featuring elements like punk rock and edgy, high-fashion looks that emphasized high heels, dark tones, and metallic accents. Collaborating closely with my stylist, Marissa Campiz, was vital. Her expertise in sourcing unique clothing materials allowed us to bring the vision to life while ensuring that the selected pieces complemented the model’s features and the overall concept. For makeup, I focused on enhancing the model's eyes to create a striking contrast against her skin. Makeup artist Natalie Seneca expertly selected colors that would not only harmonize with the outfit but also reflect the model's complexion, ensuring that the makeup was both bold and flattering.
                    
                    In terms of lighting, I envisioned a setup that would distinctly separate the model from the background, creating a soft, ethereal look that accentuated her skin tone. To achieve this, I used an extra-large umbrella with a diffuser positioned directly above the model on a boom arm. This arrangement allowed for soft, even light that wrapped around the model, minimizing harsh shadows and giving her skin a luminous quality. The umbrella's design effectively scattered the light, reducing the risk of hotspots, which can detract from the overall image. To further refine the lighting, I incorporated a second strobe equipped with a 3-inch Profoto Octo-Box, set at a lower power. This setup was crucial for filling in any shadows without overpowering the primary light source, creating a balanced and polished final image that showcased the model beautifully.
                    
                    During the editing process, I relied heavily on Adobe Photoshop to refine the images and enhance their visual impact. My workflow began with retouching, where I meticulously removed any blemishes or distractions using the Healing Brush Tool and the Clone Stamp Tool. This step is essential in high-fashion photography, where perfection is often expected. After retouching, I converted the image file to CMYK mode, specifically Adobe RGB (1998) and SNAP 2007, to maximize the color gamut. This conversion allowed me to work with a broader range of colors, ensuring vibrant results. When adjusting the selective colors, I focused on the model’s skin tones, carefully increasing the magenta levels to enrich her complexion without oversaturation. Masking played a significant role in my editing process, as it allowed me to selectively enhance areas of the image—adjusting colors, brightness, and exposure to bring out the textures and materials in the clothing while maintaining a cohesive look across the series.
                    
                    One of the primary challenges I encountered was maintaining consistency throughout the editing process to uphold a unified narrative across the images. This consistency is crucial in creating a series that feels cohesive and tells a compelling story. I developed a set of editing guidelines that I adhered to throughout the project, ensuring that each image shared similar tonal qualities and aesthetic elements. This approach not only reinforced the narrative but also highlighted the beauty and strength of Black women in alternative high fashion.
                    
                    Overall, through collaborative efforts with my talented team and a clear vision in mind, I successfully executed this series showcasing Black women in alternative high fashion. The project required significant attention to detail, particularly in the editing phase, where I worked diligently to amplify the colors and vibrancy of the diverse textures and materials used in the styling. The result is a powerful visual narrative that not only celebrates beauty and style but also contributes to a larger dialogue about representation and diversity in the fashion industry.</p>

                    For this photoshoot, I used a strategic lighting technique to create a visually compelling gradient on the background. I positioned two strobe lights at opposite angles, allowing me to manipulate the light and achieve a smooth transition of tones. The strobe lights were set at different power levels to create dynamic contrast, enhancing the depth of the background. 
                    
                    To control light spill and ensure the light was directed solely toward the backdrop, I utilized V-flats—large, flat panels that can reflect or absorb light. These V-flats helped shape the gradient and prevented any unwanted reflections from bouncing back onto the model, keeping the focus on the subject while creating a rich, textured background.
                    
                    For illuminating the model’s face, I opted for rectangular softboxes equipped with grids. This combination is particularly effective for achieving a soft yet defined quality of light. The softboxes diffuse the light, minimizing harsh shadows, while the grids provide precise control over the light’s direction, preventing it from spilling into unwanted areas of the frame. By positioning the softboxes at a slight angle above the model, I created a look that was both exposed and high-contrast, accentuating the facial features. 
                    
                    This setup resulted in a beautifully lit subject, where the interplay of soft shadows and highlights added depth and dimension, creating an engaging visual narrative that draws the viewer’s eye.
